# Student_Marks_Prediction_Model
The Student Marks Prediction System is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts a student’s academic performance based on multiple study-related and academic features. The project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using a modern web interface. 

Key Features
1. Multiple Input Features (not limited to study hours)
2. Machine Learning Model trained using scikit-learn
3. Data preprocessing & feature engineering
4. Model serialization using joblib
5. Interactive Streamlit Web Application
6 User-friendly & colorful GUI
7. Error handling and input validation
8. Clear prediction output

Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy – data handling
- Scikit-learn – model training & pipeline
