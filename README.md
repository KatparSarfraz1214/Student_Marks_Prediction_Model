# Student_Marks_Prediction_Model
The Student Marks Prediction System is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts a student’s academic performance based on multiple study-related and academic features. The project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using a modern web interface.
